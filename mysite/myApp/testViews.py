This is a classic watch, a remnant from the childhood of literally every 90-s kid. Plus, it's not juvenile. While still digital, it looks classy because of the sleek design and compact, minimalistic appearance. Nobody will judge you for wearing it to work on a Friday. But do avoid wearing this to a wedding or an interview. Those occasions need more expensive watches.Pros :1. Classic wristwear from the nineties. An evergreen bestseller. 2. Budget friendly.3. Small and compact. When I say small, I mean it doesn't look like you have an alarm clock strapped to your wrist. Unless you're a professional bodybuilder with huge forearms and a big wrist, this will not look too tiny and bad on you. That was my worry while buying this.4. The LED light. Seriously, it's a hell lot better than waking up at night wondering which century it is, trying to see the time from the pathetic radium needles of your watch and then having to get up and switch on the light. Loads better than the brightness of a smartphone that will kill your sleep. Your sleepless eyes will thank you. Trust me.5. Durability. I've been pretty rough with this. I work at a hospital as a junior doctor and I wash my hands many times a day. I don't take off the watch when I'm in a hurry. I've held this one under the tap, multiple times. Still alive and kicking. Don't have to worry about ruining costly leather.Doesn't run slow or fast. Keeps perfect time.Strap is quite sturdy despite the flexibility. It does seem like it will last a while.Cons :1. If your wrist is more than six centimeters thick side to side, avoid this. The strap won't cover it. I have a tiny wrist compared to most people and it leaves only four buckle spaces after I put it on, with me able to slide the watch up and down on my wrist.2. The LED light isn't that bright. It's basically a small bulb at one corner. It goes dark the moment you take your finger off the switch. Better battery saving, imo. Avoid unnecessary wastage from bumping the watch somewhere. But then again, this watch stays out of the way. You can rarely bump it against something and damage it in your daily life. That's all folks. I'd totally recommend this watch to anyone who needs a decent, yet cheap and durable watch.", "1. Vintage look.2. Strap is great, not the best but still lasts at least 5 years.3. Very accurate. Accurate to about +1s a day.4. Includes a timer, calender, alarm, a feeble light.5. Battery lasts 7 years at the minimum, for most people who don't use an alarm, it lasts 10 years.6. Cheap.7. 2 Years casio warranty.", "The watch is very light weight which I like .The design and the wrist looks and feesl very  good.I like that it has so many features like alarm,light and stopwatch.The only thing i experienced which i think might be a problem for some people is that in my watch the day and date update at noon and not at 12am.Also,when I opened the box the watch was set with wrong time and date which i didn't expect.but I still gave it 5 stars because I like the watch very much.It does the job of showing time and I got used to the noon update of date and day.The watch is original,I hold the button on the right and it displayed Casio and when all the three button are held, it shows all the functions so it is an original.", 'This is the highest selling watch on all time. And a masterpiece of Japanese ingenuity. If you are a retro tech lover or a watch enthusiast, your collection will never be complete with the legendary F-91W.', "If you are a watch person you can't not like this watch, you just can't. It's a beautiful, classic, elegant and timeless design. weights like air, everything works perfectly battery lasts for 7-10 year as I heard of. but yeah its worth it. This watch can't go wrong. wear it on a lazy Sunday and you feel amazing. The buzz that it makes every hour,aahh.and even if you are never gonna wear it, just buy it. It feels good just by staring at it.", "You will love wearing it. I have a Casio G-Shock. However I don't want to wear that after using this F-91W. Simple, clear & crisp display. No distraction.Simple time keeping. Splash proof. You will not regret buying it. It bring backs your school time memories. Go for it. Thanks to Casio for making it available in this highly sophisticated era of gadgets.", "Edit : I purchased this at Rs 725. But now this is being sold at almost Rs 900. That's an overkill. They are just milking on the good reviews and history of this watch.I have a thin wrist, so this watch fits perfectly. It doesn't look weird but if you are blessed with a thick wrist,I would not recommend this for you. It can be dismissed as a children's watch, yes but it is amazingly light and I got into a habit of wearing this most of the time. I have also purchased a Gshock DW 5600e along with this, but I am wearing this much more than the gshock just because it is so light, even compared to the lightest gshock model. However,I expected this to be little more durable, I can see 2 scratches on the plastic frame near the dial, the dial however is scratch free till now. Also if you enjoy the history attached with a watch more than any eye candy design you'll definitely like this. I used to wear a bigger Sonata digital watch before this but the comfort level and fitting of f91w is just unmatched.", 'Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\n\n  \xa0If I say, it is my first wrist watch. I have researched and bought it. I need a inexpensive option which I think no better that F-91.', 'Recieved a copy product.box is not sealed.looks exactly original but not same.some fake chinese product.timer functions ok but this is not original casio.Above all casio vintage package not gicve. This is youth series.i already have a casio youth series and this is n9t casio vintage packaging.asked for a replacement.', "It's NOT a only-for-kids watch!If you want a watch for what a watch does, this is the best you can have. I'm using it for 4 months now and hardly do I ever take it off. An ultimate companion for a no-nonsense person. I just love it!"]
